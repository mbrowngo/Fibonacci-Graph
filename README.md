Fibonacci-Graph
===============

Graph of the first 50 fibonacci numbers

This coding test:

Write a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence for 50 iterations. 
Log the results to the browser console. 
Graph this data using a Javascript graphing library.

I have not done much graphing, but wanted to experiment with d3 so this is my first time out of the gate
with d3. I did the test twice, once with d3 and CSS only (see other repository) and this version with SVG as well. 
Since the goal of the test wasn't to learn d3 or SVG, I didn't spend that much time formatting, although I might
in later iterations that are not part of this coding test.
